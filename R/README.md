# R Visualizations (EV Adoption Analysis)

This folder contains the R-based visualization layer of the EV Adoption Analysis project.  
R is used here to turn analysis-ready datasets into clear, interpretable visuals that help tell the story behind EV adoption trends.

## Purpose
The goal of this R workflow is to translate structured outputs from SAS into charts that are easy to interpret and suitable for reporting or portfolio presentation.

Specifically, this module is used to:
- Create visual summaries from SAS-generated tables
- Keep visualization work separate from data preparation and analysis logic
- Ensure all figures are reproducible and generated directly from code

## Inputs
The R script reads CSV files produced by the SAS pipeline. These files contain cleaned and summarized data, allowing the R code to focus purely on visualization.

Inputs include:
- EV registrations by model year
- BEV vs PHEV adoption trends
- Top counties and cities by EV adoption
- Manufacturer market share
- Electric range by adoption group

## Outputs
All figures generated by the R scripts are saved in the `figures/` directory as PNG files.

- `scripts/`  
  Contains R scripts responsible for generating visualizations from SAS outputs

- `figures/`  
  Stores the generated charts and plots

## How this fits into the overall project
This project follows a modular approach:
- **SAS** handles data cleaning, aggregation, and analytical table generation
- **R** focuses on visualization and insight communication

This separation keeps the workflow clean, reproducible, and easy to extend.
