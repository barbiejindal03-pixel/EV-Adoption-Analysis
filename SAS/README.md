# SAS Analysis (EV Adoption Analysis)
This folder contains the SAS program used to prepare analysis tables from the Electric Vehicle Population Data dataset.  
SAS is used as the primary data processing and analysis engine for cleaning, aggregating, and summarizing EV adoption data.


## Purpose
The purpose of this SAS workflow is to transform raw electric vehicle registration data into structured, analysis-ready tables that can be used for reporting, visualization, and downstream analytics.

Specifically, this module is used to:
- Clean and prepare raw EV population data  
- Generate summary tables for key adoption metrics  
- Produce standardized outputs for visualization in R  

## What This Script Produces
The SAS program generates summary tables covering:
- EV registrations by model year  
- BEV vs PHEV adoption trends  
- Top counties by EV adoption  
- Top cities by EV adoption  
- Manufacturer market share analysis  
- Electric range summaries by adoption group  

## Data Source
**Electric Vehicle Population Data (Data.gov)**  
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data

## Analysis Results (PDF)
The full output generated from the SAS analysis, including summary tables and adoption trends, is available as a compiled PDF report:

**EV Adoption Analysis – SAS Results (PDF)**  
(`ev_adoption_analysis_results.pdf`)

## SAS Analysis Outputs
This folder also contains finalized output tables generated by the SAS program `ev_adoption_analysis.sas`.

These CSV files represent cleaned, analysis-ready results derived from the Electric Vehicle Population dataset and are suitable for downstream analysis, visualization, or modeling.

### Output Files
- **`ev_by_year.csv`**  
  Annual electric vehicle registration counts by model year.

- **`ev_by_year_type.csv`**  
  EV adoption by year and vehicle type (BEV vs PHEV).

- **`top_counties.csv`**  
  Top counties ranked by total EV registrations.

- **`top_cities.csv`**  
  Top cities by EV adoption, including county context.

- **`make_share.csv`**  
  Manufacturer-level EV market share across the dataset.

- **`range_by_adoption_group.csv`**  
  Electric range summary statistics grouped by adoption intensity  
  (high, mid, and low adoption regions).

## Notes
- Outputs were generated using **SAS Studio (Web)**  
- Raw data is stored separately in the `raw_data/` folder  
- CSV outputs are intended for reuse in visualization and modeling workflows
