## SAS Analysis
This folder contains the SAS program used to prepare analysis tables from the **Electric Vehicle Population Data** dataset.

## What this script produces
- EV registrations by model year  
- BEV vs PHEV adoption trends  
- Top counties and cities by EV adoption  
- Manufacturer market share analysis  
- Electric range summary by adoption group  

## Data source
**Electric Vehicle Population Data (Data.gov)**  
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data

## Analysis results (PDF)
The full output generated from the SAS analysis, including summary tables and adoption trends, is available below:

**[EV Adoption Analysis – SAS Results (PDF)](./ev_adoption_analysis_results.pdf)**

## SAS analysis outputs
This folder also contains finalized output tables generated by the SAS program  
`ev_adoption_analysis.sas`.

These CSV files represent **cleaned, analysis-ready results** derived from the Electric Vehicle Population dataset and are suitable for downstream analysis, visualization, or modeling.

## Output files

- **ev_by_year.csv**  
  Annual electric vehicle registration counts by model year.

- **ev_by_year_type.csv**  
  EV adoption by year and vehicle type (BEV vs PHEV).

- **top_counties.csv**  
  Top counties ranked by total EV registrations.

- **top_cities.csv**  
  Top cities by EV adoption, including county context.

- **make_share.csv**  
  Manufacturer-level EV market share across the dataset.

- **range_by_adoption_group.csv**  
  Electric range summary statistics grouped by adoption intensity  
  (high, mid, and low adoption regions).

## Notes

- Outputs were generated using **SAS Studio (Web)**  
- Raw data is stored separately in the **raw_data** folder  
- CSV outputs are intended for reuse in visualization and modeling workflows
